## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Welcome!

I have a Bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences and I'm ready for an entry-level role in tech, combining my multidisciplinary background with technical skills to build intelligent systems and extract valuable insights from data.

Currently, I am focusing on *Generative AI*, *automation*, and the development of *autonomous agents*. I am also dedicated to improving my skills in *problem-solving*, *storytelling*, *system integration*, *statistics*, as well as *Python frameworks for Gen AI and Data Science*, *SQL*, *data visualization*, and other essential competencies to create scalable and efficient solutions.

Skills:

Curiosity / Critical thinking / Problem-solving / Emotional intelligence
