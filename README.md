## Hi there, welcome!

I hold a bachelor’s degree in **Biological Sciences**. My academic and professional background has been grounded in **marine and coastal environments**. This foundation strongly influences both my technical interests and the types of problems I aim to solve.

Currently, my work and studies are focused on **Deep Learning** and **Computer Vision**, with particular attention to applications in environmental and marine contexts. I am continuously strengthening my skills in **Python and R for AI and Data Science**, **statistics**, **problem-solving**, and **data storytelling**, alongside practical competencies in **SQL**, **data visualization**, and the development of **scalable, efficient analytical solutions**.

### 🌊 Fun Fact

Pearls are the only gemstones created by a living organism that require no cutting or polishing to reveal their natural beauty. Even more fascinating, the same biological process that forms a pearl is essentially a defense mechanism: when an irritant enters a mollusk, it is coated with layers of nacre, turning a potential threat into a gemstone through time, chemistry, and biology. From a materials science perspective, nacre is so well engineered that it is stronger than many synthetic composites, combining hardness and resilience in a structure humans still struggle to replicate.
