## Hi there 👋, Welcome!

I have a Bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences.

Currently, I am focusing on *Deep learning* and *Computer vision*. I am also dedicated to improving my skills in *problem-solving*, *storytelling*, *statistics*, as well as *Python frameworks for AI and Data Science*, *SQL*, *data visualization*, and other essential competencies to create scalable and efficient solutions for environmental problems.
