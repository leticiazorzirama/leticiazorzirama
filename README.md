## Hi, welcome 👋

I am a biologist working at the intersection of **Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Marine Science**.

Currently, I am a researcher at the **Applied Marine Studies Laboratory (LEMA)** at the University of Vale do Itajaí, Brazil, where I research and test **deep learning models based on optical satellite data** to locate and classify fishing vessels within marine protected areas. As part of this work, I also contribute to the **customization of domain-specific datasets** to support model training and evaluation.

Alongside my research activities, I am building a solid foundation in **mathematics, statistical modeling, deep learning, and AI engineering**, with hands-on experience using **Python**, **PyTorch**, **R**, and **SQL** for data analysis and experimental pipelines. My repositories are currently being structured to document experiments, methodologies, and applied research workflows.
